- -s or --smiles: The SMILES-string of a molecule you want allign with the reference molecule (this argument should be wrapped like a string like this: "NC(C(=O)N1Cc2c(C1)cccc2)CC(=O)N1CCN(CC1)C(c1ccc(cc1)F)c1ccc(cc1)F")
- -o or --out: The filepath that indicates where the outputfile should be written to
- -c or --conf: [optional] The amount of conformations that should be generated. The default value is 50.
- -t or --time: [optional] The amount of time spent searching for the maximum common substructure (MCSS). Usually, a result is quickly found, but the algoritm tries to exhaustively check every possibility. After the set time (in seconds) is up, the algorithm will continue with the best found result.
